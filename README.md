# Angular_TaskTracker_TS

This is a full stack project with Angular framework on the front end and a fake back end using json-server to run JSON data on localhost.

I used typescript for writing the code. and Native HTML, CSS, and angular font awesome for styling.

Also used routing module to move between the components of the project. also, tried to make the components reusable by using interfaces and passing the events between components.

Used Subject to notify several components for one event. Used http module to implement the CRUD operations to the data asynchronously where the data is returned in Observables
